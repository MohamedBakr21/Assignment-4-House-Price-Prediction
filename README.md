🏡 Housing Price Classification (Logistic Regression)
📌 Project Overview

This project uses the California Housing Dataset (housing (1).csv) to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a house has a high value (above the median price) or not.

The workflow includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding)

Model Training (Logistic Regression)
